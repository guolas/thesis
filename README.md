## Date: June 1st, 2015

### Abstract: 

The need for higher data rates and higher efficiency in cellular networks motivates the use of UFR (_Universal Frequency Reuse_). Coordination among BS (_Base Stations_) is required then to alleviate the performance penalty due to the interference. Global coordination is too complex and has inherent limitations that prevents it from being used in real world scenarios. Clusters of a reduced number of BS can be considered in order to ease off the requirements of coordination. As a result, OCI (_Out of Cluster Interference_) appears, affecting negatively the communications.

This work focuses on BD (_Block Diagonalization_), a linear precoding technique that combines a good theoretical performance with a relatively low complexity. However, the unwanted interference seriously impacts the results obtained using BD.

This thesis studies the downlink of a clustered cellular network, where BD is used to coordinate the BS within each cluster. The mean achievable rate is analyzed as a function of several scenario parameters. Of particular interest is the dependence on the cluster size, which yields that there is an optimum cluster size, beyond which no significant gain is obtained. Fairness considerations are analyzed in the presence of OCI, also studied as a function of scenario parameters such as the power allocation.

A mixed strategy using BD and SU (_Single User_) processing is proposed as a means to overcome the impairment of the unhandled interference. The transmission consists of two stages:

- Users locally decide which transmission strategy they prefer and send this information to the BS.
- BS use the decisions of all users to schedule them for transmission so that the performance of the network is optimized.

The result of the proposed strategy is an improvement in the performance of BD in the presence of OCI, especially for the users experiencing the worst conditions. This means that the fairness of the system is also increased, along with the overall performance of the network.
