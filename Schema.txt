This is the skeleton for the structure of the document:

- Introduction:
	Talk a bit about the evolution of the cellular networks, how 4G and 5G is
	requiring more and more rate, how MIMO promised things but they are not
	happening because of the dread interference!

- State of the Art:
	Talk about the interference, how it is handled in many situations, focusing
	on Block Diagonalization.
	Problems with Block Diagonalization, and how clustering can help.
	Problems with clustering, how scheduling may help.

- System/Reference Model:
	Talk about the system model, including the description of Block
	Diagonalization.

- Clustering:
	Papers from TCOM and CommLetters.
	Include some kind of link to the next section, as in the problems of 
	considering the clustering, which allows for some extra interference not
	managed.

- Scheduling:
	This would be the paper-to-be about the scheduling and threshold choosing
	bullshit.

- Conclusions
